# New Concepts of CP

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing new concepts in **C++** that I will explore step by step.  
It mainly focuses on **C++ STL (Standard Template Library)** and other useful programming techniques for **Competitive Programming (CP)**.

## Topics Covered
- Vectors  
- Pairs  
- Maps  
- Strings  
- Sets  
- (More to be added as I progress)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document and practice new concepts I learn in C++ for improving problem-solving and competitive programming skills.
